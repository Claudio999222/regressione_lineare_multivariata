# Exploratory Data Analysis and Regression Metrics

In this notebook, we will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset, focusing on correlations with the features of interest. Additionally, we will calculate key regression metrics, including the intercept, angular coefficients, mean absolute error, maximum absolute error, and variance. We will also create correlation plots between predictions and training data, identifying features that yield the best training results for our model.

## Topics Covered:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: An examination of correlations between features of interest and the target variable.
- **Offset Calculation**: Determination of the intercept (offset) for the regression model.
- **Angular Coefficients**: Calculation of coefficients representing the impact of each feature on the target variable.
- **Regression Metrics**: Computation of metrics such as mean absolute error, maximum absolute error, and variance.
- **Correlation Plots**: Visualization of correlations between predictions and actual training data.
- **Feature Importance**: Identification of features that contribute most to the model's training.

This notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, enabling insights into feature correlations and model performance metrics. By examining the relationships between features and target variables, we gain a better understanding of the dataset's characteristics.
